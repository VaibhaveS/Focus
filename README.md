#### Features

- [x] Average response time of the interviewee
 
 The delta seconds for each question answer pair is calculated and added to a global sum to calculate the overall average response time of the interviewee.
 
 This allows the interviewer to gauge the interviewee in terms of how quick he is to think and answer questions i.e, decision making.
 
- [x] Bar chart signifying the count of each emotion
 
 A bar chart showing the average frequency of each emotion shown to get an overall idea of what emotion was displayed in response to the stimuli given, for example, a difficult question. 
 
- [x] Number of active speakers (in a normal interview setting it should be two, but may vary)
 
 Number of active speakers based on audio component of the meeting is found and displayed.
 
- [x] Number of questions asked
 
 From the numerous sentences from the audio transcript, questions that were asked are recognised and the count is returned.
 
- [x] Percentage of non-trivial questions
 
 From the questions asked, the number of non-interesting questions are found using TF/IDF and an existing dataset of both interesting and non-interesting questions.
